4. Collect red food to grow longer and earn points

6. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself

## Game Controls

## Technical Implementation

This project uses the following technologies:

- HTML5 Canvas: For game graphics rendering
- JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity
- CSS3: For styling and responsive design

The game is built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, with no external dependencies.

## Game Mechanics

- The bear moves in a grid-based environment
- Each time the bear eats food, it grows longer
- Golden bonus food appears randomly and disappears after a short time
- The game ends when the bear hits a wall or itself
- The score increases with each food item collected
